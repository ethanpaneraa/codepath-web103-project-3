        about: "Logan Square Mutual Aid is part of a city-wide mutual aid effort, organized neighborhood by neighborhood. We all live here in Logan Square, and, when the coronavirus broke out in Chicago, many of us began looking for ways to contribute what we could to our neighbors. Seeing as we are stronger together, we are excited to join forces here. We know that during this pandemic there will be economic, health, and other hardships. We are here to support the community in fulfilling those immediate essential needs. We are providing food so no one goes hungry, prescription and grocery pickups for people who are sick, elderly, or immunocompromised, and whatever other needs arise.",
